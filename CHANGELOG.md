## 1.0.0-rc.11.exp.20170724.0
  * Update to Polymer JS [v1.9.2](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.9.2)
  * removed dep on `smoke` (raises analyzer compatibility)

## 1.0.0-rc.11
  * Update to Polymer JS [v1.8.1](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.8.1)

## 1.0.0-rc.10
  * Update to Polymer JS [v1.6.0](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.6.0)
  * __breaking change__ : `notifyPath` signature has been changed in order to
    mirror the `JS` version (parameter `fromAbove` is now an optiona parameter
    instead of a named one)

## 1.0.0-rc.9
  * Update to Polymer JS
    [v1.4](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.4.0)
    * Added `activeElement` method to `PolymerDom`

## 1.0.0-rc.8
  * Update to Polymer JS
    [v1.2.3](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.2.3)
    * Added a workaround for the fact that many custom events now use a normal
      Event object when fired from JS.
    * Added `deepContains(node)` method to `PolymerDom`.
    * New `strip-whitespace` attribute supported for element templates.
    * New `PolymerRenderStatus` class.
        * Static getter `whenReady` which returns a Future that completes after
          the initial render of the entire app is done.
        * Static function `afterNextRender(element)` which returns a Future that
          completes after that element is done being rendered the next time.

## 1.0.0-rc.7
  * Added the `unlisten` method for removing late bound event listeners.

## 1.0.0-rc.6
  * Moved `test` to a dev_dependency and removed the `code_transformers`
    dependency.

## 1.0.0-rc.5
  * `notifyPath` now supports the `fromAbove` argument.
  * Added a `PolymerCollection` class which can be used to deal with keys in
    notification paths.
  * Updated the `Templatizer` behavior with the `modelForElement` method.

## 1.0.0-rc.4+2
  * Fix `clear` method so it supports deep paths.

## 1.0.0-rc.4+1
  * Ensure that `interop_support.html` is loaded before polymer. This fixes an
    issue where built in elements (like `dom-bind`) that existed on the page
    initially might not get properly upgraded.

## 1.0.0-rc.4
  * Update to Polymer JS
    [v1.2.0](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.2.0).
  * There are a few new methods on the `PolymerBase` mixin:
    * `List<Node> getEffectiveChildNodes()`
    * `List<Element> getEffectiveChildren()`
    * `String getEffectiveText()`
    * `Element queryEffectiveChildren(String selector)`
    * `List<Element> queryAllEffectiveChildren(String selector)`
    * `bool isLightDescendant(Element node)`
    * `bool isLocalDescendant(Element node)`
  * New methods on `PolymerDom` class which enable dom mutation observers:
    * `observeNodes(void callback(PolymerDomMutation mutation))`
    * `void unobserveNodes(handle)`
  * Path notifications now distinguish between array indices and keys. The
    `set`, `get`, and `notifyPath` apis all support both array indices and keys
    as well.

## 1.0.0-rc.3
  * Fix `node` optional argument to `fire` method of `PolymerBase` class.

## 1.0.0-rc.2
  * Call `convertToJs` automatically on any events passed to `Polymer.dom`,
    [#28](https://github.com/dart-lang/polymer_interop/issues/28).

## 1.0.0-rc.1
  * Update to polymer js
    [v1.1.4](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.1.4).
  * Add transformer which switched to the minified version of polymer in release
    mode.

## 0.2.0
  * Update to polymer js
    [v1.1.0](https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/tree/v1.1.0)

## 0.1.1
  * Delete `lib/src/polymer.js` when deploying to reduce output size.

## 0.1.0+2
